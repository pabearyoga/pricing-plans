# Pricing Comparison Table

This project involves the creation of a pricing comparison table that displays three subscription plans: Basic, Standard, and Premium. Each subscription plan includes essential information such as the plan name and type, monthly price, billing frequency, a list of features with checkmarks (✔) or crosses (✘) to indicate availability, and a "Sign Up" button. Additionally, users can toggle between monthly and yearly billing, and the prices and billing frequency will automatically update. The table features a modern and visually appealing design with a complementary color scheme, distinct styling for buttons, features, and the table header, as well as hover effects on plan buttons. The CSS is organized and styled using SASS, implementing variables, mixins, and nesting effectively. The table is also designed to be responsive for various screen sizes, including mobile, tablet, and desktop.
